## Writing code for readability

### Best practices accumulated through years of writing code and doing code reviews

#### 1. Linters

I always recommend that before you start writing code, prepare your Text Editor/IDE first.

Having a good looking display is great as it will lessen the strain in your eyes. But modern editors and

IDEs can do more than just that. They can help you write code by suggesting the best practices

developed by large companies and people with long years of experience with writing code. They can

even spot possible errors. This is through the use of linters. Linters are often add-ons to your

Editor/IDE. Install them and let them help you write your code better.


#### 2. Learn of your Programming Language's Coding Standards

Notice this isn't the first advice? Because linters are the fastest way to apply the standards

to your code. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read your language's standards.

Read it, try to be familiar with it and understand the reasoning behind each coding standard.

Over time, by using linters and applying these standards to your code, you start to

know them by heart. And by then YOU become the linter of your own code.


#### 3. Think and write like an author

I see a lot of starting coders not utilising this simple concept of "blank lines".

Remember when you try to read a book and you see the pages so populated with text 
with no blank lines between paragraphs? Yeah, you probably didn't proceed to read it.

It immediately looks exhausting to read, isn't it?

Same goes with writing code. Try to group your lines of code that are similar then add a

blank line before you write code that have a different purpose from the other lines.

Think and write like an author. Lines of your code can be grouped into a "paragraph". And give your

readers some pause.


#### 4. Make your code future-readable and future-understandable rather than future-proof

The common pitfall of most starting coders is that, they try to make their code future-proof.

Meaning, they are already thinking of different possible scenarios that their code could produce

an error once another coder changes it. So they code it until it "cannot" fail to a point that it becomes complicated.

But we know it isn't possible. So the code ended up complicated but still fallible.

So the better way of thinking, is to make it future-readable and future-understandable.

This way, future readers of your code can understand WHY you wrote your code that way.

Remember, it's better to have a code that fails but you understand why, than a code

that works but nobody wants to touch it since it might break.
